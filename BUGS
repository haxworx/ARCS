list of some bugs:
------------------


arcs --get does not set .git/info/exclude


warn in case of conflicts, don't rely on -v mode.
grep err or maybe run `conflicts` ?


need locking for running arcs, or it might run twice at once; and on server


it does not detect disk-full errors, so db.txt gets trashed (not a big problem)


git checkout -f  now seems to renumber all the files :/

problem when renaming directories or delete directory and rename a file to the
directory's old name.  Not sure if git itself handles this right!



Error: arcs_init: getenv("USER")




fsh gets stuck sometimes



still doesn't cleanly finish the arcs update thing when pushing



doesn't transmit empty dirs
  (this is a git issue. could add a .keep file?)

Error: can't replace database
Error: can't replace database




when pushing, it does 3 steps, if the remote project files change during this
changes can be lost.  need a locking method.  (or different backend / technique)






FIXED BUGS:
-----------


0.3.5 can't create a repository remotely - need like an inverse "clone" - or use rsync in that case :/   - FIXED


Now, how to clone the other way, like a pull?  that doesn't work too! - DONE


$ arcs

ARCS 0.5.0.3a at sam@alice.nipl.net:/home/sam/profile
Already up-to-date.
error: remote 'refs/heads/origin' is not a strict subset of local ref 'refs/heads/origin'. maybe you are not up-to-date and need to pull first?
ARCS 0.5.0.3a at sam@lust:/home/sam/profile

  # couldn't fix that one dunno why, needed to rebuild

  FIXED (I think) - now delete "origin" branch after clone.  to fix existing
    repos, run git-branch -d origin



arcs is using sprintf instead of snprintf
    FIXED
