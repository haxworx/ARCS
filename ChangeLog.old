	  permission, Al can maintain / release a GPL'd version.

2009-05-30
	* Sam - ported arcs to work with msysgit on windows.
	* enabled elf-repellant by default

2009-04-18
	* Sam - tidied up scripts, don't commit if build-stamp exists, extra
	  options for scripts, added more manpages.

2009-02-26 - 2009-03-03
	* Sam - Update call to git-pull to work with newer git.
	* changed format of output to be hopefully more readable
	* sshc server= comand   for a remote command in the same directory
	* added -q quiet option
	* ignore "modified" directory
	* unified -q with -v, 6 levels of verbosity from -q -q -q to -v -v
	* don't pull / push if unnecessary
	* speed up the -f option (!)
	* fixed so it will handle symlinks to directories
	* modified to use ctime not mtime, so it will notice metadata changes.
	  This makes it a little more eccentric but I want it to track mode.
